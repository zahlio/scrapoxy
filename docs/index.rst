What is Scrapoxy ?
==================

http://scrapoxy.io

Scrapoxy **hides** your scraper behind a cloud.

It starts a pool of proxies to send your requests.

Now, you can crawl without thinking about blacklisting!

It is written in Javascript (ES6) with `Node.js`_ & AngularJS_ and it is **open source**!


How does Scrapoxy work ?
------------------------

1. When Scrapoxy starts, it creates and manages a pool of proxies.
2. Your scraper uses Scrapoxy as a normal proxy.
3. Scrapoxy routes all requests through a pool of proxies.

What Scrapoxy does ?
--------------------

- Create your own proxies
- Use multiple cloud providers (AWS_, DigitalOcean_, OVH_, Vscale_)
- Rotate IP addresses
- Impersonate known browsers
- Exclude blacklisted instances
- Monitor the requests
- Detect bottleneck
- Optimize the scraping


Why Scrapoxy doesn't support anti-blacklisting ?
------------------------------------------------

Anti-blacklisting is a job for the scraper.

When the scraper detects blacklisting, it asks Scrapoxy to remove the proxy from the proxies pool (through a REST API).


What is the best scraper framework to use with Scrapoxy ?
---------------------------------------------------------

You could use the open source `Scrapy framework`_ (Python_).


Does Scrapoxy have a SaaS mode or a support plan ?
--------------------------------------------------

Scrapoxy is an open source tool. Source code is highly maintained.
You are very welcome to `open an issue`_ for features or bugs.

If you are looking for a commercial product in SaaS mode or with a support plan,
we recommend you to check the `ScrapingHub`_ products
(`ScrapingHub`_ is the company which maintains the `Scrapy framework`_).
